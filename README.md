uvcpp
=====

uvcpp is a C++ wrapper of [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv).
uvcpp is inspired by [uvw](https://github.com/skypjack/uvw) with the idea to make it easier to work with libuv, it has simpler and different implementation detail than uvw.

This project is still not complete, it is growing.
